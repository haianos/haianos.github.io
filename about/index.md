# Bio
<p style="text-align:justify">
Enea Scioni, Ph.D., received his B.Sc. and M.Sc degrees in Computer Science
and Automation Control Engineer from University of Ferrara (Italy) in 2007 and 2010,
respectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
From 2011 to 2016 he pursued a <b>joint</b> doctoral degree in Engineering Science
at the universities of Leuven (KU Leuven, Belgium) and Ferrara (University of Ferrara, Italy),
under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~bruyninc/">Herman Bruyninckx</a>
and Prof. <a href="http://docente.unife.it/docenti-en/bnfmcl/curriculum?set_language=en">Marcello Bonf√®</a>.
The PhD degree has been obtained in April 2016, with a dissertation titled
<b>"Online Coordination and Composition of Robotic Skills: Formal Models for Context-aware Task Scheduling"</b>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
During this period, he worked on formal modelling of the execution dependencies between different
motion skills on redundant mobile manipulators. He was a main developer of the Hierarchical Hypergraphs
Domain-Specific Language NPC4; from kinematics to software architectures, Finite State Machines,
or Bayesian perception networks. Another realisation is the formalisation and tooling support to let robot skill descriptions and executives work with geometric constraints, from which the robot motion controller can itself derive its instantaneous setpoints. On this dual basis, he developed the models and the software to let two-armed mobile manipulators optimize the scheduling of their actions at runtime, including a "Just-in-Time" optimization of the decisions
which arm and gripper in the robot will be used to perform all tasks.
</p>

Currently, Enea is a postdoc research fellow at [KU Leuven Robotics Group](http://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/robotics),
which is also affiliated to [Flanders Make](www.flandersmake.be/en) research center.

# Research Projects

Enea is currently involved in several research projects, under the flagship of the European Community (Horizon-2020)
and the local <a href="http://www.flandersmake.be/en">Flanders Make</a> strategic research center for the manufacturing industry in Flanders.

More details on those projects can be found [here](/projects/index.hmtl).

# Software Projects

Enea is currently involved in the development of several software libraries
and middleware applied to robotics. An exhaustive list will be provided soon.

# Interests

Enea's current research interests are on formal specification and
scheduling of constraint-based tasks, optimization-based robot control
and coordination of complex robotic systems.
His research also concern on developing software middleware tools and
Domain Specific Languages (DSL) to realize advanced robotic applications.
