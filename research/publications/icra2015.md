# Abstract

Symbolic reasoners generate plans which are often
not exploiting the robot capabilities and are sensitive to runtime
disturbances. This work proposes a scheduler as an interface
between a discrete, symbolic plan and a motion control based
on constraint optimization. Acting as a local reasoner, the
scheduler valuates a set of predicates to decide when an action
will be executed. Given a task specification which describes
how the action should be realized, the scheduler configures
the controller at runtime. A demonstration will be provided
considering an “open drawer” scenario.
